If you are getting rotation information from RasMol (with WRITE RASMOL
foo.ras) then you need to do the following two transformations first
before applying the rasmol transformations:
       rotate y 180
       rotate x 180
Then REVERSE THE DIRECTION OF THE Z ROTATION from the RasMol file.

Alternatively, use the Molscript information (with WRITE MOLSCRIPT
foo.mol)
